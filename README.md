# GhoulGuard Cybersecurity LinkTree

This is a simple LinkTree-style hub I made for my budding cybersecurity firm. 

The page links to some resources I use or think are important, like TryHackMe, the OSINT Framework, the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and HaveIBeenPwned.

I built this as part of a learning program. Mostly HTML and CSS, nothing too fancy, but it works and captures the look I'm going for.
